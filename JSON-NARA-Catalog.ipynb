    "# Archival Descriptive Metadata & JSON \n",
    "Many cultural organizations, such as the **US National Archives**, provide a read-write web API *(Application Programming Interface)* for accessing catalog content from a program. Typically, these catalogs when queried through API calls, return JSON-formated data.  This data can be viewed through a JSON Browser or through regular browsers (sometimes requiring a JSON extension).  An online viewer we have used is:  **jsoneditoronline.org**\n",
    "\n",
    "## NARA's Hierarchical Catalog Structure:\n",
    "<img src=\"./Images/NARA-LCDRG.png\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Record groups** and **collections** are the highest level of archival description. Record groups most often contain accessioned records from federal agencies. Collections are generally made up of non-federal records that were donated to NARA, usually from presidential administrations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Beneath the record group or collection is the **series**. A series is a group of records that are related as the result of being created, received, or used in the course of the same activity. The series is the descriptive level that is connected to the archival creator - the person or organization who created and/or maintained the records.\n",
    "\n",
    "And beneath the series are **file units** or **items**. File units contain a more specific collection of related records within a series. A file unit often contains multiple discrete records, for example a grouping of memos.  File units are always contained by series, while items can be contained by either series or file units. An item often reflects a specific record, for example a single memo. Both file units and items can contain digital objects, such as digitized pages produced from analog holdings.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The National Archives Catalog API contains all:\n",
    "- Archival description metadata\n",
    "- Authority record (persons, organizations, geographic references, topical subjects, and specific records types) metadata\n",
    "- Digital object metadata (including technical metadata)\n",
    "- Public contributions to the catalog (like tags and transcriptions)\n",
    "- Metadata for crawled web pages of archives.gov and presidential libraries\n",
    "- Some metadata for user accounts\n",
